- 👋 Hi, I’m @LloydBrownn
- 👀 I’m interested especially in systems programming and desktop application development, but the scope of my interests really is limited to what I know!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in C++ using generic, object-oriented, and functional styles.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any desktop application or operating system that uses C++; however, I'm willing to look into ANY codebase that uses C++ to get valuable experience.
